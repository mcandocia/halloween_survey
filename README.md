# 2018 Halloween Survey Analysis

This October I sent out a survey via Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, and email, asking respondents about how they celebrated Halloween, including what costumes they wore, what ages they went trick-or-treating, among other questions.

See [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9migltZ2djegT8XvrphHmdnhWaIM4sMR9PDMsbPIXm0pGYQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) for non-prize version of survey.

Various techniques, including raking, survival analysis, and hierarchical clustering are implemented in the source files above, although they are a bit unorganized, as they were primarily made to produce content for my web page.

The following are articles produced using the above code and data.
